<h3>Fitness Center Database Project</h3>
This project focuses on learning SQL and practicing database design and query creation. The goal is to build and manage a fitness center database with tables such as Trainers, Activities, Schedule, Members and others. By working on this project, I have learned how to design a relational database, implement SQL queries, and manage data effectively. Uploaded repository consists of SQL queries and seed data which was generated using Mockaroo tool.

<h4>Tehnologies</h4>
<li>PostgreSQL</li>

<li>SQL</li>

<h4>Features</h4>
<li>seed data</li>
<li>SQL queries</li>
<li>table relationships</li>
<li>custom queries</li>

## Installation
To use this project locally, you need to set up a PostgreSQL database and import the provided SQL files. Download and install **PostgreSQL** from [here](https://www.postgresql.org/download/).

<h3>Steps to install</h3>

1. **Clone the Repository**: Clone the project repository to your local machine.

   ```
   git clone https://github.com/ivonaaaa/Internship-6-FitnessCenter.git
   cd Internship-6-FitnessCenter
   ```
1. **Create a new PostgreSQL database**: After cloning the repository, create a new PostgreSQL database where you will import the schema and seed data. Do this by right clicking on Databases and choosing 'Create > Database'.
2. **Insert all of the queries into the database**: Right click on newly added database and choose 'Query Tool'. Once it opens, find the folder icon or press 'Ctrl+O'. Find the queries in the cloned repository and add them one by one by repeating this process.
3. **Place the seed data**: In order to be able to implement the generated seed data into the database, you need to place the 'Seeds' folder into your 'Public' local folder. This should be on location "C:\Users\Public\Documents".
4. **Run the queries in this order**: FitnessCenters.sql, SeedData.sql, AdditionalData.sql, Query.sql
